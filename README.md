# Human Trafficking Risk Prediction

This project uses machine learning and deep learning models to predict human trafficking (HT) risk using spatial-temporal crime and event data in NYC. It incorporates traditional ML (LightGBM, XGBoost) and advanced LSTM/ConvLSTM sequence models.

##  Problem Statement
To identify high-risk locations and times for HT-related activity in NYC by analyzing patterns in crime, events, travel data, and direct reports.
