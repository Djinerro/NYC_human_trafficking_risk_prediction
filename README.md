# üõ∞Ô∏è Human Trafficking Risk Prediction (NYC, 2021‚Äì2024)

This project identifies spatio-temporal hotspots of **human trafficking (HT) risk** in New York City using multi-source data and predictive modeling techniques. It was developed in collaboration with Metro Analytics as part of the Rutgers MBS Advanced Analytics Practicum.

> **Techniques used:** Supervised LSTM modeling, XGBoost baselines, unsupervised clustering (HDBSCAN, KMeans), anomaly detection, spatial grid design, and real-world validation.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Human trafficking is a covert and often underreported crime, masked within broader categories like assault or sex work. Traditional data sources are sparse or misclassified, making direct detection extremely difficult.

This project builds a **multi-layered modeling pipeline** to forecast risk using indirect signals like:
- Crime patterns
- Event density
- Mobility flows
- Calendar and location context

---

## üß† Modeling Approach

- **Supervised Learning:**
  - XGBoost and LightGBM used as benchmarks
  - **LSTM** model trained on 7-day spatio-temporal sequences
  - Output: continuous risk score per (date, location)

- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - **HDBSCAN & KMeans** used for spatial clustering
  - Identified organic hotspots of HT risk from raw coordinates

- **Contextual Validation:**
  - Socioeconomic overlays (poverty, unemployment)
  - Sentiment analysis on local businesses
  - Scraping illicit ad frequency data as future signal

## üß™ Results Snapshot

- **LSTM Model**: AUC = 0.77, Recall = 75% at 0.2 threshold
- **XGBoost Baseline**: AUC = 0.51, Recall = ~2%
- **Top features**: Borough, recent crime trends, passenger volume
- **HDBSCAN**: Found tight clusters with silhouette scores > 0.9
